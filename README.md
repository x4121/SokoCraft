# SokoCraft
Sokoban for Minecraft

## Idea
The idea of this mod is to combine the '90s puzzle game Sokoban with known Minecraft mechanics.

## Current state of development
This is still in earliest stages of development and nowhere near stable/playable.

## TODO
* Fix configuration loading
* Smooth block movement
* Better block-leftclick mechanic to detect clicked side
* Implement way to reset blocks
* Add inventory to dispenser/dropper blocks
* Implement "wrench" functionality (pickup blocks, rotate, lock/unlock)
* Add sounds
* Add different properties/features per block color
* Add block hit damage against entities
* Add timer with automatic reset
* Test a lot
* Sneak mod into big modpack :D
